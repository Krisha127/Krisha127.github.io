            <h3>Sustainable development goals reel</h3><br>

            <p >For my project on sustainable development goals, I created a short reel focused on Goal 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production. Using Canva, I designed the video from scratch with the objective of raising awareness about our excessive consumption habits and their detrimental impact on our planet and environment.<br><br>

              This project marked my first deep dive into video making and editing, and despite using Canva, which is user-friendly, I acquired a wealth of new skills and knowledge. I learned how to effectively convey a message visually, synchronize elements for maximum impact, and utilize various design tools and features to enhance the quality of my content.<br><br>
              
              The reel highlights the pressing need to adopt more sustainable consumption patterns, illustrating how our current habits contribute to environmental degradation, resource depletion, and pollution. By showcasing statistics, impactful visuals, and actionable tips, the video aims to inspire viewers to make more conscious choices in their daily lives.<br><br>
              
              Creating this video was a valuable experience that not only deepened my understanding of sustainable development but also equipped me with practical skills in video production and editing. I am excited to apply these new skills to future projects and continue advocating for sustainability in innovative and engaging ways.</p><br><br>
